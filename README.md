# ARM Assembly Instruction Set Practice

This repository contains a series of short ARM assembly programs, each designed to demonstrate specific instruction types and memory addressing techniques. The files are structured to incrementally introduce and test key low-level concepts that underpin computational performance, binary arithmetic, and hardware-level logic—all of which are essential for roles involving embedded analytics, edge computing, or systems-level performance tuning.

## Use Case for Data Scientists

Understanding these low-level operations is relevant for:

- **Algorithm Optimization**: Insights into how code is executed on hardware helps optimize high-frequency trading models or real-time inference systems.
- **Embedded AI/ML Applications**: Knowing register-level logic is crucial when deploying models to microcontrollers, mobile processors, or custom accelerators.
- **Security Analytics**: Low-level analysis is foundational for reverse engineering, malware analysis, and side-channel investigations.
- **Compiler-Aware Optimization**: Helps in tuning compiled code and understanding hardware bottlenecks in model training or inference loops.

## Getting Started

To assemble and run:

```bash
as -o program.o programX.s    # Assemble
ld -o program program.o       # Link
./program                     # Execute
